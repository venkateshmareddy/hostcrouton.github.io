           The "About Us" page is a great place for it to live, too.
           Good stories humanize your brand, providing context and meaning for your product.
           Whatâ€™s more, good stories are sticky -- which means people are more likely to connect with them and pass them on.
           </p>
           <p className="ContentPara2">Every company has a story to tell,
           so break out your storytelling skills from that random English class you took years ago
           and put them to work on your "About Us" page. Using descriptive and emotive copy and gorgeous graphics,
           an "About Us" page with a story works harder for your business than a generic one.
